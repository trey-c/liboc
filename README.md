# Overpowered C

`liboc` is a general-purpose object and utility library for C.

The goal of the library is to provide an object system, data structures, and other convenient utilities while keeping the memory usage small.

The project is currently under heavy development, and is inspired by [GLib](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib) :heart:
